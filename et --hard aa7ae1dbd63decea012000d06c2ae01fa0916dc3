    Switch to Xposed Installer's UID/GID in logcat/app service
    
    These two access files written by Xposed Installer. If they're running
    with the same permissions as Xposed Installer, the files and directories
    don't need to be world-readable/writable.
    
    Note that even before, those processes didn't have any special
    permissions, despite UID 0. That's because they don't have the
    DAC_OVERRIDE capability, which would ignore file permissions.
    
    So instead of being able to read/write root's files, we can now
    read/write Xposed Installer's file (plus files readable/writable by
    anyone).
    
    One problem is that in order to determine the UID/GID of the Xposed
    Installer, the process needs to run in app context. But from this
    context, SELinux doesn't allow changing the UID anymore.
    
    Therefore, the UID/GID needs to be determined in some other way. This is
    done via a separate process which stats the directory and returns the
    result via shared memory. The processes which want to change their
    UID/GID can then do this before switching their context.
    
    This conflicts with single-process service mode (which was used as an
    optimization when SELinux is disabled) because only processes with
    special UIDs can add services. Therefore, we always need to use two
    services, one running as root in system context and one running with
    Xposed Installer's permissions in app context. The latter is actually
    processing requests, the first one is used for registering the services.
    
    It also requires that the logcat process runs with Xposed Installer's
    permission, but having AID_LOG as secondary group is sufficient to read
    all logcat entries.

    Clone objects directly to the target class
    
    Cloning an object with a different size causes some checks to fail. Even
    though the proper target class will be set almost immediately, this
    sitation can occur, especially under high load and with certain debug
    features enabled. So better create the new object with the correct
    class. Requires a change in the ART projects as well.

    The previous order was a bit confusing. It's more logical to think of
    the daemon as the main process which is closely connected to Xposed,
    with the logcat process as subprocess that just delivers the log data.

    Close certain files temporarily before forking
    
    This is to work around a new security feature introduced by Google in
    the November 16 patches. It would abort the runtime if files are open
    that are not whitelisted. To avoid this, we close the files ourselves
    and reopen them after Zygote has forked. The mechanism is the same that
    Google has introduced, with a few modifications to fit Xposed's needs.
    
    This requires also a change on the Java side.
    
    Fixes rovo89/XposedBridge#129.

    Start Xposed logcat daemon after Xposed services
    
    Allows us to read settings from /data via the services a bit earlier.
    There's only a small chance that errors will occur while the services
    start, which would now no longer be visible in the error.log (still in
    the logcat though). However, even writing the logfile requires some
    similar mechanisms as the services (e.g. SELinux context switches), so
    the overall impact is very small.

    Fix a racing condition in ZygoteService
    
    The low-level logic for the ZygoteService uses one server process and
    multiple client threads in the Zygote process(es). Data is transferred
    between these threads using shared memory, a mutex and a condition
    variable. Whenever one of the threads wants to start an operation, it
    has to wait until the shared memory is in the correct state.
    
    With pthread_cond_signal(), it was possible that not the correct thread
    woke up. For example, client A might have woken up client B, leaving
    the server thread sleeping and the operation would never be finished.
    Similarly, the server might not have woken up the client whose request
    it was currently serving, but a different client which was waiting to
    start a new request.
    
    Using pthread_cond_broadcast() fixes it, the checks whether the threads
    should really do something are already in place.
    
    Fixes #152.

    Adjust SYSTEMSERVERCLASSPATH for HTC devices
    
    They make use of a HtcDeviceInfoManager class from /system/framework/ub.jar
    in the ActivityManagerService.  This works fine on odex'ed ROMs because
    the class is precompiled. But with Xposed, the odex file can't be used
    as-is and has to be recompiled before. This would be done later by the
    PackageManagerService, but then it's too late.
    
    As a solution, add ub.jar to the SYSTEMSERVERCLASSPATH if it exists.
    In the end, it's exactly that: A class which is used by the system server.
